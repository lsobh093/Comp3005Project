# Comp3005Project
Welcome to my fitness management system:

Purpose:
To design and implement a fitness management system that allows members, trainers, and staff admin members to store, interact with, and retrieve data correspnding to distinct types of data. The ER model for the database and it's corresponding transformation into a database schema are provided (ER model.docx and SchemaDiagram.png). I have also included a file (How to use the application.docx) to explain how a user should interact with the application, and the intended goal of each function/trigger function/view/table, etc...

Check the Instructions to Run Application word document file to get started.

The files included within this github repository include:
Java files:
Main.java
UserInteraction.java
MemberFunctions.java
MemberRegistration.java
MemberDashboard.java
MemberAchievements.java
MemberExercises.java
MemberHealthFunctions.java
MemberNutrition.java
MemberPrivateRegistration.java
MemberRegistration.java

SQL Files:
DDL File: ProjectDDL.sql
DML File: ProjectDML.sql

Created Views to enhance data viewing:
CalendarforMembers VIEW.sql
ClassAvailability VIEW.sql
Member_details VIEW SQL.sql
PrivateClassesCalendar VIEW SQL.sql
PrivateSessionsViewerForTrainer VIEW.sql
trainer_calendar VIEW SQL.sql

Created Trigger Functions:
FINAL_calculate health statistics.sql
FINAL_check session conflict.sql

The functionality of each file and their purpose, and how they are supposed to interact with the database is explained in detail in separate files:
1. Java Files.txt
2. SQL Files.txt
